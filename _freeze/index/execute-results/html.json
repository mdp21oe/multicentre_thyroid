The aim of the study is to understand the epidemiology and management pathways of thyroid nodules in the UK.This was a retrospective study over a 6-month period. We included all consecutive adult patients referred for investigation of a thyroid nodule.Twelve centres including 573 patients with median age of 54 years were included. Incidental detection was reported in in 31.6%. The U classifications were: U1 (0.5%), U2 (45.6%), U3 (44.4%), U4 (7.2%), U5 (2.3%). Of the patients who had FNAC, the Thy classifications were: Thy1 (21.9%), Thy2 (37.5%), Thy3a (10.3%), Thy3f (20.9%), Thy4 (4.7%), Thy5 (4.7%). Core biopsy was performed in 8 (1.4%) patients. The initial management was thyroidectomy in 23.6% and conservative management in 72.8%. In the latter group, 55.8% were offered routine review in a median period of 24 weeks and 15% had a change in the initial management strategy. The postoperative pathology was malignant in 41.3% of patients. Age, BMI, previous neck radiation, incidental nodule, and rapid growth factors were not significantly associated with thyroid cancer. The proportion of cancer in ‘Thy3a’ and ‘Thy3f’ nodules were 42.9% and 47.9% respectively.\n\nplain-language-summary: |\n  Earthquake data for the island of La Palma from the September 2021 eruption is found ...\nkey-points:\n  - A web scraping script was developed to pull data from the Instituto Geogràphico Nacional into a machine-readable form for analysis\n  - Earthquake events on La Palma are consistent with the presence of both mantle and crustal reservoirs.\ndate: 2024-01-18\nbibliography: references.bib\ncitation:\n  container-title: Earth and Space Science\nnumber-sections: true\n---\n\n\n## Introduction\nThe epidemiology of thyroid nodules and in particular modes of presentation and pathology, is not well characterised in the UK @RN1714.  Common reasons for referral of patients with thyroid nodules to secondary care include neck lump, abnormal thyroid function test and compressive symptoms.  Incidental thyroid lesions are increasingly being identified @RN3295. Given how common thyroid nodules are, and the low yield thyroid cancer (4-6.5%) @RN3296 in patients with presenting with thyroid nodules, most patients referred via this pathway are likely to have benign disease @RN1733. The standard practice for evaluating thyroid nodules in the UK includes ultrasound evaluation to grade the nodule as per the BTA ultrasound classification system. Anecdotally, there is thought to be variability with regards to the initial management of nodules and follow up of patients. The aim of this study was to understand the modes of presentation and distribution of pathologies in thyroid nodules, and the  management pathways.\n\n## Methods\n3.1\tCentre eligibility All secondary care centres investigating and managing patients with thyroid nodules were eligible for inclusion. Potential individual principal investigators were invited to participate in this study through the British Association of Endocrine and Thyroid surgeons (BAETS). Each centre was required to have a consultant PI and a trainee lead to manage the study within their centre. Centres were required to contribute consecutive patients presenting with thyroid nodules within the study period to be eligible for participation. The expectation was that each site would contribute at least 30 consecutive patients to the study. A total of 42 sites (including the lead site) initially showed interest in participating in the study. The potential consultant PIs of each site were contacted via email with the study protocol and guidance for registration of the study locally. In addition, the local research offices were contacted. At least four reminder emails were sent to each site over a six-month period. Seventeen sites completed the local registration process, but only 14 sites contributed data towards the study. Three sites were sent reminders at least three times over a six-month period, but no data was provided. Two sites contributed a total of 4 patients each; they were sent reminders at least three times over a six-month period to provide more data However, no further data was provide; these sites were excluded. Data from 12 sites were included in the final analysis. 3.2\tPatient inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: All adult patients (aged 18 or above) being referred for investigation of thyroid nodule to secondary care. Exclusion criteria The exclusion criteria were as follows: •\tPatients attending clinics for follow up appointments after investigation or treatment or for continuation of conservative treatment. •\tNew patients referred for specialist treatment from another secondary care setting. •\tPatients referred again after being seen or treated previously for a thyroid nodule in the last 2 years. 3.2.1\tParticipant identification and recruitment There was no direct contact with patients given the retrospective nature of the study. Patient records that met the above inclusion criteria were eligible for inclusion. Methods for identifying potential records were outlined and circulated to each centre (see Figure 1.) 3.3\tVariables Data on the following variables were collected: patient demographics, referral details, clinical examination findings, initial investigations, initial management, pathology results. Data were collected from existing patient clinical records (including clinician letters, result of investigations and operation notes). Missing data was be noted. 3.4\tData collection Data was collected using a standardised data collection form. See Appendix 2. This was piloted on 10 patients initially and then further refined prior to being finalised. The data collection form was created on RedCap database. The RedCap database is an online data collection tool established for the use in multicentre research studies. 3.5\tData analysis All data collected was transferred to SPSS software for analysis. An initial descriptive analysis of the variables were performed. Continuous data was summarised as mean and standard deviation (SD) if normally distributed, and median and interquartile range where non-normally distributed. Categorical data was summarised as frequency and percentages.The chi squared test was used to examine the relationship between categorical variables and outcome of thyroid cancer. Independent sample t test or the Mann Whitney U test was used to evaluate the association between continuous variables and thyroid cancer depending on whether the data was normally or not normally distributed. Patients with a Thy2 cytology were considered to have benign pathology.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nA total of 15 centres were included in this study; contributing a total of 584 patients. The mean (SD)\nage of patients included was 54.3717728 (16.6520009) years. The patients were\nrecruired from the following clinics: ENT 280 (47.9452055%); General Surgery\n131 (22.4315068%)...\n\n## Results\nA total of 15 centres were included in this study; contributing a total of 584 patients. Table 1 shows centres included in the study. The mean (SD) of patients include was 54.3717728 (16.6520009). The number of patients contributed by each centre ranged from 19 to 106 patients. The patients were recruited from the following clinics: ENT 280 (47.9452055%); General Surgery 131 (22.4315068%), Joint thyroid 75 (12.8424658%); Medicine 59 (10.1027397%); Other 11

two-week wait (2WW) cancer pathway in 175 (29.9657534%) of cases. Smokers and non-smokers represented 88 (33.7%) and 173 (66.3%) respectively. Of note 312 (54.4%) of patients did not have smoking status recorded. \n\nOf those who had BMI recorded 27.7723874 (5.7083148.Of the patient population, 10/473 (2.1%) were recorded to have history of previous neck irradiation. Data on previous neck irradiation was missing in 100 patients. A total of 460 patients had the American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) classifications recorded. The ASA classifications were as follows: ASA I, 186 (40.4%); ASA II, 201 (43.7%); ASA III, 70 (15.2%), ASA IV, 3 (0.7%). Modes of presentation A total of 392/573 (68.4%) of thyroid nodules presented with neck symptoms. Other modes of presentation were as follows: biochemical hyperthyroidism, 26/573 (4.5%); biochemical hypothyroidism, 4/573 (0.7%); symptoms of abnormal thyroid function, 22/573 (3.8%). Thyroid nodules were found incidentally on imaging in 181/573 (31.6%) of patients; the imaging modality was recorded in 178 patients. Ultrasound neck was the commonest modality for identification of incidental thyroid nodules 75/178 (42.1%). Other modality for identification of incidental nodules were as follows: CT scan, 55/178 (30.9%); MRI, 24/178 (13.5%); nuclear medicine scan 24/178, (13.5%). Symptoms at presentation The following symptoms at presentation were recorded: neck lump, 364/573 (63.5%); compressive symptoms (breathing or swallowing difficulty, or voice change), 87/573 (15.2%); symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, 34/573 (5.9%). A total of 136/573 (23.7%) of patients were considered asymptomatic at presentation. Clinical assessment Rapid perception of growth of the nodule was noted in 54/506 (10.7%) patients. Data on rapid perception of growth was missing in 67 patients. A total of 519 patients had data provided on clinical palpable nodules. On clinical assessment, 265/519 (51.2%) of patients had a single palpable nodule. No nodule was palpable in 161 (31.0%) patients. Retrosternal extension was suspected in 15/397 (3.8 %) patients. Data was missing on retrosternal extension in 176 patients.Thyroid function test (TFT) was done within three months of presentation in 475/570 (83.3%) of patients. Data on TFT was missing in three patients. Ultrasound Most patients 551/573 (96.2%) had an ultrasound scan either prior to or following initial assessment in secondary care. Description of the thyroid nodule on ultrasound was available in 544 patients. A single thyroid nodule was seen in 204 (37.5%); more than one thyroid nodules were seen in 321 (59.0%) of cases. The median (IQR) maximum diameter of the largest nodule was 23 mm (13-34). The BTA U classification for thyroid nodules was reported in 432 patients. The BTA U classifications were recorded as follows: U1, 2 (0.5%); U2, 197 (45.6%); U3, 192 (44.4%); U4, 31 (7.2%); U5, 10 (2.3%). See table 7 for the distribution of BTA U classification in seven sites who reported in at least 30 patients. TIRADS reporting was use in 49/574 (8.6%) of patients. Associated abnormal cervical lymphadenopathy was recorded in 26 patients (4.5%). Elastography was not used in any patient to assess the thyroid nodule. Other imaging CT neck was performed to further evaluate the thyroid nodule in a total of 67/573 (11.7%) patients. Commonest reasons for CT evaluation were retrosternal extension (18 patients) and tracheal compression (16 patients). Other reasons documented were extrathyroidal extension/local invasion (7 patients) and extent of lymphadenopathy (7 patients). Furthermore, MRI neck was done in 25/573 (4.4%) patients; commonest reason was to evaluate for extent of lymphadenopathy (7/25, 28%).FNAC FNAC was performed in a total of 377/573 patients (65.8%) of patients. of these, The BTA Thy classification system was provided in the pathology report in 301 (79.8%) of patients who had FNAC. The BTA Thy classifications of the nodules were as follows: Thy1, 66/301 (21.9%); Thy2, 113/301 (37.5%); Thy3a, 31/301 (10.3%); Thy3f, 63/301 (20.9%); Thy4, 14/301 (4.7%); Thy5, 14/301 (4.7%). The Thy classification system was not reported in 76 (13.3%) patients. We examined four sites that had a least 30 patients with FNAC done, to see the distribution of results. See Table 8, it highlight variability in the distribution of FNAC result. Core biopsy was done in 8 patients. Other imaging CT neck was performed to further evaluate the thyroid nodule in a total of 67/573 (11.7%) patients. Commonest reasons for CT evaluation were retrosternal extension (18 patients) and tracheal compression (16 patients). Other reasons documented were extrathyroidal extension/local invasion (7 patients) and extent of lymphadenopathy (7 patients).

The result has provided insights into characteritics of thyroid nodules presenting in the secondary care. Multiple health visits, various investigations and, multiple specialties involved.5.1\tVariability across sites in the multicentre study There was significant variability in total number of patients contributed  by each site. The sites have different volume of thyroid and endocrine surgery which may explain this variability. In addition, some sites were district general hospitals which have a relatively lower volume of patients compared to the teaching hospital units that have a greater volume of patients referred to them.  One potential reason for the variablity in the number of patients per centre could be that not all consecutive patients during the study period were included. Given the restropective nature of the study, and potential difficulty in accurately identifying all eligible patients, this is a distinct possibility. To improve identification of all elibigle patients, we provided each centre with a flow chart and guidance to improve identification of all suitable patients, thus minimising this risk. It was accepted that centres may have different systems in place given the variability in methods of storing electronic records between hospitals. 5.2\tReferral for thyroid nodules ENT clinics contributed the most number of patients (48.3%) to this study. General medical clinic and other specialty contributed around 16% of patients to this study; this highlights the wide range of  specialties that initially assess thyroid nodules in secondary care. Of note each site that were included in the study had thyroid surgeons or endocrine physicians. It is thought that most thyroid nodules were referred from primary care, this was confirmed by our results. However, a large proportion (26%) were inter specialty referral within secondary care. One reason for this is the increasing identification of incidental thyroid nodule on imaging. We found around 52% of patients with thyroid nodule were referred through the 2WW referral pathway. The national institute for health and care excellence (NICE) has provided guidelines for clinicians on the recognition and referral of suspected thyroid cancer. They advised clinician to consider referral within two weeks for thyroid cancer in patients with unexplained thyroid lump (Suspected cancer: recognition and referral 2015). However, the BTA guidelines advised the two week rule to be applied only in patients with additional suspicious features (i.e. unexplained hoarseness/voice change, thyroid nodule in a child, cervical lymphadenopathy, a rapidly enlarging, painless, thyroid mass over a period of weeks) (4). The thyroid cancer guidelines update group  recommends optimal care in patients with suspicious clinical features can be delivered  by using a target of 4-week pathway from referral to assessment in clinic (4). Our findings suggest UK  practices still adopt  2WW referral for the majority of patients. One explanation for this high proportion could be primary care physician referring to NICE guidelines for unexplained thyroid lump. The BTA specialist guidelines may not be readily utilised by primary care. 5.3\tInvestigations for thyroid nodules Majority of the patients had thyroid function tests done before referral, this is in keeping with national recommendations. This helps stratification of referral pathways; patients with suppressed TSH in association with a new thyroid nodule are very unlikely to have thyroid cancer. Thus these patients are best referred to endocrinology; in addition a non urgent referral is also advised (4). Generally, most patients with a thyroid lump will undergo a thyroid ultrasound, in keeping with national recommendations (4, 5). Of note, 3.8% of patients in our study did not have an ultrasound at initial assessment. It is unclear why they did not. Given the rates of incidental nodules being picked up in patients, it can be argued that not all patients with thyroid pathology require thyroid ultrasound. Around 60% of patients who had an ultrasound where found to have more than one thyroid nodules; this further emphasises how common thyroid nodules are. The relatively high proportion of patients undergoing FNAC demonstrates the need for better predictors to avoid unnecessary biopsies. The BTA U classification system outlined specific features for radiologist to look out for in each category, with the view of reducing variability between assessors. However, varibility may still exist between radiologists. Utilising machine learning approach may help in reducing variability and improve stratification of nodules to benign and malignant (6). Risk stratification may be aided by the use of additional predictive factors such as specific demographic and clinical features (7). Ultrasound adjuncts such as elastrophy is increasing being studied to help stratification of nodules into benign or malignant (8). None of the centres included in our study used this modality. It appears that it is not a technique adopted to the UK. It is thought most patients undergoing thyroid surgery for thyroid nodules are young and fit patients with minimal comorbidity.Our results showed that patients had ASA I-II status in only 80% of instances. Thus diagnostic thyroid surgery has the potential to reduce the benefit risk ratio, particulary in the context were majority of patients have benign pathology. Incidental nodules found on imaging represented around 30% of our study population. The definition of thyroid incidentaloma varies in the literature; in this study  incidentaloma was defined as thyroid nodule found incidentally on imaging. Ultrasound of the neck was the commonest modality for identification of incidentaloma, followed by CT scan. Nodules meeting threshold for biopsy (U3 or above on ultrasound) are then referred for thyroid cytology. Studies have shown no difference in the rates of cancer between clinically apparent nodule and incidental nodule (9). The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer and the potential over diagnosis is largely attributed to identification of incidental nodules (10)  . However, if the incidentally detected nodule has similar risk of cancer to the clinically apparent nodule, it will need to be investigated. This suggests that attempts to address thyroid cancer over diagnosis may be to reduce need for imaging as opposed to limiting investigations of nodules detected on imaging. Furthermore a pragmatic approach could be not commenting on incidental nodules less than 1 cm; as in the context of thyroid cancer, recent guidelines that advised clinicians can consider a conservative approach. This is a challenging topic to address as clinicians will be concerns about not excluding thyroid cancer and patients may have ongoing concerns even though the literature will suggest most nodules are benign and subcentimetre thyroid nodules could be managed conservatively (11). The terminology could be another point to consider, thyroid cancer in the context of micropapillary carcinoma still creates anxieties for patients. autopsy study has show thyroid cancer in thyroid specimens that was never detected clinically, these patients died from other causes(12). CT scan was rarely used in the evaluation for thyroid nodule; it was reserved in cases of suspected retrosternal extension or extrathyroid extension which is in keeping with national guidelines. Given most thyroid nodules are benign, we can assume a large proportion of nodules do not require FNAC. FNAC is generally done in patients who meets threshold for suspicion of malignancy on ultrasound assessment. Limitations of FNAC includes non diagnostic specimen and indeterminate results.  We found non diagnostic samples in 21% of patients. Indeterminate results carry a variable rate of malignancy: 10-30% for Thy3a and 10 to 40% for Thy3f. This varied across centres; likely attributed to variability in cytological assessments. In the setting of Thy3f, diagnostic hemithyroidectomy is advised, and in Thy3a, repeat US and biopsy is typically done on follow-up. FNA was performed in around 53% of patients in our study population. Of the patients who had FNAC, the Thy classification result were as follows: Thy1 (21.9%), Thy2 (37.5%), Thy3a (10.3%), Thy3f (20.9%), Thy4 (4.7%), Thy5 (4.7%). This shows around 30% of thyroid nodule nodules were indeterminate; 20% overall requiring diagnostic thyroidectomy. Looking at the four sites that performed at least 30 FNAC in patients, there was significant variation in the frequency of indeterminate pathology results. The proportion of Thy3a and Thy3f which had malignant pathology were 42.9% and 47.9% respectively. Thus, over 50% of the indeterminate nodules that undergo diagnostic surgery were benign on final pathology. This exposes a great number of patents without thyroid cancer to morbidities associated with thyroid surgery. This highlights the need for better discriminator in distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules. 5.4\tMolecular testing for thyroid nodules Molecular testing is increasing being used in the evaluation thyroid nodules. Molecular markers have been developed to improve decision making in patients with indeterminate results from FNA. Available molecular assays include Affirma® GSC; ThyGenX/ThyraMIR® ThyraGeNEXT/ThyraMIR®; and Thyroseq v3®(13). Molecular markers identify genetic mutations that are associated with malignancy to further aid stratification of indeterminate nodules. Most patients with indeterminate nodules have a thyroid lobectomy for definitive diagnosis; a negative molecular test result that has a high negative predictive value has the potential to reduce the need for diagnostic surgery. The accuracy of the molecular tests is however affected by the prevalence of malignancy. Thus, a lower prevalence of malignancy will result in a lower positive predictive value, and a higher negative predictive value (14). The utility of these molecular markers in patients with indeterminate FNA result is under debate. This is because a large proportion of patients with indeterminate nodules on FNA eventually are found to have benign disease. In addition, malignancy in this group represents well differentiated thyroid cancer with an excellent prognosis (14). These molecular tests have a low PPV (20-40%) for malignancy in patients with indeterminate nodules (14). This is because the probability of an indeterminate harbouring malignancy is inherently low (15). In addition, the genetic alterations identified with the assays are not solely unique to carcinoma; these can also be seen in adenomas (14). Caution has been advised with interpretation of the tests (16). These tests are not available for routine use in the UK. 5.5\tFollow-up for patients with thyroid nodules. In cases where no intervention was planned following initial assessment, 55% of patients were offered routine review in a median period of 24 weeks. This highlights the increase workload associated with the management of thyroid nodules; this workload created by the uncertainty in FNAC results. Of the patients who had routine review, 15% had a change in the initial management strategy. 5.6\tPotential risk factors for thyroid cancer evaluated in the multicentre study. On further analyses of the potential associations between risk factors and thyroid cancer, the following factors were not significantly associated with thyroid cancer in patients presenting with thyroid nodules: age, smoking, BMI, previous neck radiation, rapid growth and nodule size. As expected, associated palpable lymphadenopathy was significantly associated with thyroid cancer. Exposure to ionising radiation (especially during childhood) is an established risk factor for thyroid cancer (17). A history of radiation exposure has also been shown to increase risk of thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules (18).  This study found no significant difference in the rates of thyroid cancer between patients with and without history of previous neck radiation; but the results may be subject to recall bias or small numbers resulting in atype II error. Thyroid incidentaloma are thought to carry similar risk of thyroid cancer to nodules detected on clinical examination (2). Our findings found no significant differences in the rates of thyroid cancer between incidental nodules on imaging and other nodules detected clinically. This supports the increasing referral of thyroid nodules detected incidentally. Although these nodules could represent low risk papillary thyroid cancer, they may never become clinically apparent during the course of the patient’s life. Perception of rapid growth is considered a concerning feature in a patient presenting with thyroid nodule; as this can indicate poorly differentiated or anaplastic thyroid cancer. This study did not demonstrate any association between perception of rapid growth and thyroid cancer. 5.7\tImproving prediction of thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules. There is a need for improved differentiation between benign and malignant nodules. The tradition practice of medicine involves self-learning, acquisition of knowledge and experience to make an informed decision (19). This process is vital given the highly varied clinical environment, where decision making is based not only science but also the environment and psychosocial factors. Advances in our knowledge and understanding has created large data sets of information including a myriad of variables. There are complex relationships between variables that are poorly understood but these influence outcomes (20).  Machine learning to improve the understanding of these relationships is gaining popularity in many areas of medicine (19). Machine learning allows quick processing of large, complex data sets to estimate probability of an outcome. These techniques often have an iterative process that improve the precision over time with the addition of more information/data set (20). Furthermore, machine learning allows “personalised” medicine, whereby outcome data is generated based on an individual’s characteristics rather than fixed group probabilities (21). This property of machine learning has been adopted in medical practice to calculate individual risk of an outcome and direct informed decision making on personalised treatment (21). The use of statistical models using several variables to predict cancer risk in patients with thyroid nodules has been explored. Nixon et al. developed a nomogram to predict thyroid cancer in patients presenting with thyroid nodules (22). They included all patients who had ultrasound, FNA and resection of thyroid nodule over a one-year period (158 patients). Factors included in their nomogram included thyroid stimulating hormone; ultrasound and cytological features. This tool is based on a fixed statistical model with no process of iteration. The utility of this tool is not established and had not been adopted to routine clinical practice. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been evaluated to reduce subjectivity in ultrasound reporting. One study examined ultrasound images of thyroid nodules in 482 patients who had resection on the thyroid gland with definitive diagnosis of benign or malignant disease (6). These images were then used to create an AI algorithm for prediction of malignant disease in patients who had ultrasound of thyroid nodules. They reported a NPV of 93%, and a PPV of 81.5%. This was comparable to other reported ultrasound systems. Other AI models have also shown comparative performance to radiologist assessment (23). The role of AI in improving diagnosis of thyroid cytology specimen has been explored using various machine learning techniques (24). Some authors use the image from the cytology slides, others used data derived from the images. Varying accuracy rates have been reported. These techniques are currently under investigation for further refinement. In patients with indeterminate nodules, AI techniques have been used to stratify in high versus low risk of malignancy (25). One study evaluated stratification of 371 patients with indeterminate nodules using cytological variable found that AI techniques was better than standard criteria used by pathologist. The AI classified the indeterminate nodules into a high-risk group (33% risk of malignancy) and a low-risk group (3% risk of malignancy) (26). There is a however a lack of studies that combine data from clinical features, ultrasound and cytological variables in a model that may have the ability to improve the prediction of cancer than any one set of variables.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References\n1.\tMitchell J, Parangi S.
