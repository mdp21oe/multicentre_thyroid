abstract: |
  The incidence, modes of presentation, and distribution of pathology of thyroid nodules in the UK is not well characterised. The aim of the study is to understand the epidemiology and management pathways of thyroid nodules in the UK.This was a retrospective study over a 6-month period. We included all consecutive adult patients referred for investigation of a thyroid nodule.Twelve centres including 573 patients with median age of 54 years were included. Incidental detection was reported in in 31.6%. The U classifications were: U1 (0.5%), U2 (45.6%), U3 (44.4%), U4 (7.2%), U5 (2.3%). Of the patients who had FNAC, the Thy classifications were: Thy1 (21.9%), Thy2 (37.5%), Thy3a (10.3%), Thy3f (20.9%), Thy4 (4.7%), Thy5 (4.7%). Core biopsy was performed in 8 (1.4%) patients. The initial management was thyroidectomy in 23.6% and conservative management in 72.8%. In the latter group, 55.8% were offered routine review in a median period of 24 weeks and 15% had a change in the initial management strategy. The postoperative pathology was malignant in 41.3% of patients. Age, BMI, previous neck radiation, incidental nodule, and rapid growth factors were not significantly associated with thyroid cancer. The proportion of cancer in ‘Thy3a’ and ‘Thy3f’ nodules were 42.9% and 47.9% respectively.

  Earthquake data for the island of La Palma from the September 2021 eruption is found ...
key-points:
  - A web scraping script was developed to pull data from the Instituto Geogràphico Nacional into a machine-readable form for analysis
  - Earthquake events on La Palma are consistent with the presence of both mantle and crustal reservoirs.

## Introduction

```{r}
eruptions <- c(1492, 1585, 1646, 1677, 1712, 1949, 1971, 2021)
n_eruptions <- length(eruptions)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-timeline
#| fig-cap: Timeline of recent earthquakes on La Palma
#| fig-alt: An event plot of the years of the last 8 eruptions on La Palma.
#| fig-height: 1.5
#| fig-width: 6
par(mar = c(3, 1, 1, 1) + 0.1)
plot(eruptions, rep(0, n_eruptions), 
  pch = "|", axes = FALSE)
axis(1)
box()
```

```{r}
#| output: false
avg_years_between_eruptions <- mean(diff(eruptions[-n_eruptions]))
avg_years_between_eruptions
```

Based on data up to and including 1971, eruptions on La Palma happen every `r round(avg_years_between_eruptions, 1)` years on average.

Studies of the magma systems feeding the volcano, such as @marrero2019, have proposed that there are two main magma reservoirs feeding the Cumbre Vieja volcano; one in the mantle (30-40km depth) which charges and in turn feeds a shallower crustal reservoir (10-20km depth).

Eight eruptions have been recorded since the late 1400s (@fig-timeline).

Data and methods are discussed in @sec-data-methods.

Let $x$ denote the number of eruptions in a year. Then, $x$ can be modeled by a Poisson distribution

$$
p(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x}}{x !}
$$ {#eq-poisson}

where $\lambda$ is the rate of eruptions per year. Using @eq-poisson, the probability of an eruption in the next $t$ years can be calculated.
